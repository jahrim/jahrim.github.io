Here is more about my life and interests.

### Bio

I'm Jahrim Gabriele Cesario, I'm {{<age start="1999-03-29">}} years old, and I
was born in Lugo (Ravenna, Italy), where I lived for most of my life.

##### 1999~2013

In my early days, I attended elementary and middle school at the
[Sacro Cuore Institute](https://scuolamediasacrocuorelugo.jimdofree.com/),
where I spent most of my time learning, making friends and having fun.

##### 2013~2018

As I started high school in September 2013, I also began learning the piano at 
the [Music Institute of Malerbi](https://www.scuolamalerbi.com/), developing a
passion for music. Before that, I used to play the guitar and practice Judo,
however, I have never been adept at sports, despite my commitment.

I attended high school at
[Lyceum Gregorio Ricci Curbastro](https://www.liceolugo.edu.it/index.php),
focusing on applied sciences, namely mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics,
information technology and philosophy. Among these, my favorite subject was
mathematics, and with time I have developed a greater appreciation for
philosophy.

Here, I graduated with top marks in June 2018. Around that time, I also managed
a piano performance of Chopin's Polonaise in C# Minor, Op. 26.

During my time at high school, I have attended two stages as expected by the
work-school alternation program: a report about security in chemical
laboratories, at the campus of Faenza (RA) for
[Materials Chemistry](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/MaterialsChemistry), under
the [Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna
(Unibo)](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage); and as a laboratory assistant for a 
study on geopolymers at [CNR-ISTEC](https://www.issmc.cnr.it/).

##### 2018~2021

After high school graduation, riding the wave of digitalization, I started
attending [Computer Science and
Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering)
at a new campus in Cesena (FC), under Unibo.
During my studies, I temporarily moved to Cesena to get closer to the campus
and to start growing independent, so I started working to afford rent. In
parallel, I continued piano lessons, managing a performance of the famous
Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and a shy attempt at Rachmaninoff's Moment
Musicaux nÂ°4 in E Minor.

Here, I graduated with honors in July 2021, submitting a
[thesis](/portfolio/bachelor-thesis) focused on distributed systems,
specifically a service for social welfare, combining home automation and vocal
assistants. The thesis was developed during a stage in collaboration with the
AUSL of Bologna, under the supervision of the CRA (Regional Centre for Assistive
technology) team at the Ausilioteca.

##### 2021~2024

After my bachelor, I decided to continue my studies, attaining a
[Master's Degree in Computer Science and
Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering). I
graduated with honors in March 2024, submitting a
[thesis](/portfolio/master-thesis) focused on the simulation and 
verification of reactive aggregate systems.

In this period, I managed a piano performance of Liszt's Sposalizio in E Major.

##### Present

Nowadays, I'm open to explore my options both in the academic and the business
worlds. In my time at university, I have developed engineering skills and
project management knowledge for software solutions, but also an interest in
teaching and research, which could lead me to continue my studies. In order to 
decide on my future, I need to gather and evaluate my current opportunities.

### Interests

My main interests in Computer Science are programming languages and software
engineering. In particular, I love designing domain specific languages with the
goal of bringing domain experts near to the code, making programs and tests as
declarative as possible. Additionally, I love designing distributed systems and
interactions for complex services, involving heterogeneous devices.

In my free time, apart from working on side projects, I enjoy playing the piano,
the guitar or the violin, which I just started learning. Sometimes I even dabble
in music composition and improvisation, just for the fun of it.

In the past, I also used to play video-games to take a break from reading books
and studying. Nowadays, it's quite the opposite: I rather read books and study
to take a break from the computer, which is becoming more and more part of my
every-day routine.

Although rare, one of my favorite activities is visiting natural landscapes, in
particular walking across parks, hills or forests.
