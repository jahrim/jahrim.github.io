Here is more about my life and interests.

### Bio

##### 1999~2013

I was born in March 1999 in Lugo (RA), Italy.

I attended elementary and middle school at the [Sacro Cuore Institute](https://scuolamediasacrocuorelugo.jimdofree.com/).
In the meantime, I was learning to play guitar and practicing Judo.

##### 2013~2018

In September 2013, I started high school at [Lyceum Gregorio Ricci Curbastro](https://www.liceolugo.edu.it/index.php)
with a focus on Applied Sciences, meaning mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics,
information technology and philosophy. At the same time, I also stopped practicing
Judo and started learning the piano at the [Music Institute of Malerbi](https://www.scuolamalerbi.com/).

During high school, I attended two activities as expected by the Italian work-school
alternation program: a report about security in chemical laboratories, at the campus
of Faenza (RA) for [Materials Chemistry](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/MaterialsChemistry), under the 
[Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna (Unibo)](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage); and as a laboratory
assistant for a study on geopolymers at [CNR-ISTEC](https://www.issmc.cnr.it/).

I graduated from high school with top marks in June 2018. Around that time, I also
managed a piano performance of Chopin's Polonaise in C# Minor, Op. 26.

##### 2018~2021

In September 2018, I started attending [Computer Science and Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering)
at the new campus in Cesena (FC), under Unibo. To support my studies, I
temporarily moved to Cesena and I started working to afford rent. 

I graduated with honors in July 2021, submitting a [thesis](/portfolio/bachelor-thesis) focused on
distributed systems for social welfare, combining home automation and vocal
assistants. The thesis was developed in collaboration with the AUSL of Bologna,
under the supervision of the CRA (Regional Centre for Assistive technology) team at
the Ausilioteca. My bachelor supervisor was Prof. Alessandro Ricci.

In this period, I managed a performance of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and a shy
attempt at Rachmaninoff's Moment Musicaux nÂ°4 in E Minor.

##### 2021~2024

In September 2021, I decided to continue my studies, attending the
[Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering). 

I graduated with honors in March 2024, submitting a [thesis](/portfolio/master-thesis) focused on the
simulation and verification of reactive aggregate systems. My master supervisor
was Prof. Mirko Viroli.

In this period, I managed a piano performance of Liszt's Sposalizio in E Major.

##### 2024~Present

After exploring my options both in the academic and the business worlds, I decided
to pursue a PhD in Computer Science.

In May 2024, I moved abroad and joined the [Programming Group](https://programming-group.com/)
in St. Gallen, Switzerland. 

In September 2024, I started my PhD in the topic of Programming Languages, supervised
by Prof. Guido Salvaneschi. As of now, I am researching optimizations for formal
verification techniques, such as theorem provers.
