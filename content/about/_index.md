Here is more about my life and personality.

### Bio

I'm Jahrim Gabriele Cesario, I'm {{<age start="1999-03-29">}} years old, and I
was born in Lugo (Ravenna, Italy), where I lived for most of my life.

##### 1999~2013

In my early days, I attended elementary and middle school at the
[Sacro Cuore Institute](https://scuolamediasacrocuorelugo.jimdofree.com/),
where I spent most of my time learning, making friends and having fun.

##### 2013~2018

As I started high school in September 2013, I also began learning the piano at 
the [Music Institute of Malerbi](https://www.scuolamalerbi.com/), developing a
passion for music. Before that, I used to play the guitar and practice Judo,
however, I have never been adept at sports, despite my commitment.

I attended high school at
[Lyceum Gregorio Ricci Curbastro](https://www.liceolugo.edu.it/index.php),
focusing on applied sciences, namely mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics,
information technology and philosophy. Among these, my favorite subject was
mathematics, and with time I have developed a greater appreciation for
philosophy.

Here, I graduated with top marks in June 2018. Around that time, I also managed
a piano performance of Chopin's Polonaise in C# Minor, Op. 26.

During my time at high school, I have attended two stages as expected by the
work-school alternation program: a report about security in chemical
laboratories, at the campus of Faenza (RA) for
[Materials Chemistry](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/MaterialsChemistry), under
the [Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna
(Unibo)](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage); and as a laboratory assistant for a 
study on geopolymers at [CNR-ISTEC](https://www.issmc.cnr.it/).

##### 2018~2021

After high school graduation, riding the wave of digitalization, I started
attending [Computer Science and
Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering)
at a new campus in Cesena (FC), under Unibo.
During my studies, I temporarily moved to Cesena to get closer to the campus
and to start growing independent, so I started working to afford rent. In
parallel, I continued piano lessons, managing a performance of the famous
Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and a shy attempt at Rachmaninoff's Moment
Musicaux nÂ°4 in E Minor.

Here, I graduated with honors in July 2021, submitting a
[thesis](/portfolio/bachelor-thesis) focused on distributed systems,
specifically a service for social welfare, combining home automation and vocal
assistants. The thesis was developed during a stage in collaboration with the
AUSL of Bologna, under the supervision of the CRA (Regional Centre for Assistive
technology) team at the Ausilioteca.

##### 2021~2024

After my bachelor, I decided to continue my studies, attaining a
[Master's Degree in Computer Science and
Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering). I
graduated with honors in March 2024, submitting a
[thesis](/portfolio/master-thesis) focused on the simulation and 
verification of reactive aggregate systems.

In this period, I managed a piano performance of Liszt's Sposalizio in E Major.

##### Present

Nowadays, I'm open to explore my options both in the academic and the business
worlds. In my time at university, I have developed engineering skills and
project management knowledge for software solutions, but also an interest in
teaching and research, which could lead me to continue my studies. In order to 
decide on my future, I need to gather and evaluate my current opportunities.

### Personality

Some people might perceive me as fitting the stereotype of the diligent
student, preferring solitude and dedicating fully on its academic or 
professional career. This is probably true to some extent. However, I believe
that my behavior is mostly a consequence of the level of commitment I put into
what I do. I hold myself to high standards and strive to meet them
consistently. 

As a consequence of my commitment, I may occasionally appear socially 
withdrawn. Throughout my life, I have experienced alternating periods of
introversion and extroversion towards other people, and in both cases this
aspect of me persisted. That is to say, I am not necessarily introverted, as a
matter of fact, learning music and live performances made me more extroverted. 
However, I do have a strong sense of individuality and independence.

In my time at university, this strong sense of individuality led my to
undertake many projects by myself, even a few that were supposed to be team
projects. In doing so, I acquired skills across a large variety of development
facets, attaining increased autonomy as a developer.

Still, I had several chances to work in team projects, in which I believe I
demonstrated good collaboration skills (e.g., proposing my ideas, accepting the
ideas of others, leading towards certain directions, being led towards others),
but also good leadership skills, encouraging the team towards a common
objective. In particular, I believe that maintaining balance and trust within
a team is key to success: a leader should provide good reasons to be trusted
and fair opportunities for other team members to build trust within the team,
supporting them in undertaking challenges during the development of a project.
A fair leadership also requires good understanding of the team members' 
needs and effective communication.

### Interests

In my free time, apart from working on side projects, I enjoy playing the piano
and the guitar. Sometimes I even dabble in music composition and improvisation,
just for the fun of it. In the future, I would like to try the violin too, as
each instrument has taught me a different perspective on music and trained my
hearing in a different way.

In the past, I also used to play video-games to take a break from reading books
and studying. Nowadays, it's quite the opposite: I rather read books and study
to take a break from the computer, which is becoming more and more part of my
every-day routine. Still, I maintain a passion for video-games, which I nurture
from time to time.

Although rare, one of my favorite activities is visiting natural landscapes, in
particular walking across parks, hills or forests.
