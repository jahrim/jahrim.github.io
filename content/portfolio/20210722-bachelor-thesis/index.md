### Title

Development of a Domotic System Integrated with a Vocal Assistant Supporting
Social Welfare Services Based on Gamification

### Supervisors

**Supervisor**: Prof. Alessandro Ricci

**Co-supervisor**: Ing. Massimiliano Malavasi

**Co-supervisor**: Dr. Laura Bugo

### Abstract

In recent times, domotic solutions have emerged as means to facilitate domestic 
life, allowing optimization and automation of every-day tasks. For some people,
domotics may even offer a perspective of independence, in which impracticable
activities become finally accessible, proving an invaluable technology in
support of the elderly and people with disabilities.

In collaboration with the AUSL of Bologna, in particular the CRA (Regional 
Centre for Assistive technology) team at the Ausilioteca, led by coordinator
Ing. Massimiliano Malavasi and guided by neuropsychologist Dr. Arianna
Gherardini and software developer Dr. Laura Bugo, this project involves the
design and development of an educational service integrated into a domotic
system, allowing training of cognitive skills. The primary objective is to
deploy this suite within a social welfare context to assist people with
disabilities or cognitive impairments, monitoring their progress during their
psycho-educational program under the supervision of qualified staff.

The suite includes the integration of heterogeneous domotic solutions through a
centralized control system, providing a unified standard interface. The domotic 
system is also integrated with a vocal assistant for increased accessibility
and for communicating with an educational service. The educational service 
exposes three cognitive games based on vocal interactions for training
short- and long-term memory, attention, imagination, orientation, and 
executive functions, such as response inhibition.
